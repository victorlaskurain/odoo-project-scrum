Description
===========

Create and manage Scrum Sprints inside Odoo. 100% integrated in Odoo's
standard project management addons.

Data Model
----------

The main data model is the Scrum Sprint which mainly holds a set of
tasks to be completed by a development team in the given time frame.

The Scrum Master can add tasks to a sprint and manage them as he
pleases. He can even mix tasks from different projects. The level of
dedication of each team member defined as the % of her time dedicated
to this sprint can be managed on a daily basis if required although
most of the time setting the dedication for the whole sprint in one go
will be more useful.

Access control
--------------

Only members of the Scrum Master group can create and manage
sprints. Project users can view sprint's information but other than
updating the estimation for the delivery of a task they are not
allowed to touch it.

Usage
=====

The main access point is the :menuselection: `Project --> Scrum`.
